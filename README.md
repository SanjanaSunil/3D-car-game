## Game play

* Your player is a race car and a police car is chasing you! 
* Use right and left arrow key to move left or right and spacebar to jump.
* Avoid smashing into crates and sharp fences or the game will end!
* Hitting wooden fences once will slow down the car and the police will catch up. Hitting it again will lead to end of the game.
* Collect as many coins as possible to increase your score!
* Collect flying boosts to increase your height temporarily. The walls will start to flash red when the powerup is almost used up.
* Collect jump boosts to jump higher and avoid obstacles better.
* The walls flash periodically.
